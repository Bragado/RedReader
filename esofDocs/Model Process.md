### Abstract
In the context of the subject ESOF we intend to analyze the software processes used by ...
Regarding the software process we will be going over on how the different typical phases of most process models are/were handled by the developers followed by an analysis of which models best fit what they have been doing.

###Introduction

### Project structure


####Release Schedule

Looking at the first table we found that initially very close to the beginning of the launch of the first version of this project, several changes were released from the same version on the same day and even multiple versions have been released in a short time (from day to day) due to suggestions that emerged from the users and even to correct some bugs detected.
However, from version 1.9.3.1 the project now has two versions, one of them the Alpha version, in order to avoid that the next version of the application contains many bugs.
  
####Release Branches

Redreader is a incremental development application that allows developer to take advantage of what have learned during inicial phase and beyond that, suffers updates in a way that application will keep attractive and innovative to the user.
Is constantly releasing new versions. The developer tried using branches for the development of the application, but was not good succeed, so opted to stay only to develop in the branch master. The suggestions given by users and application bug fixes are only developed in a continuous and gradual in the master branch.

####Release Cycle

There doesn't seem to be a defined time of release for each new version of the application. Over the past year, the time intervals between major releases ranged from one to four months. If necessary, there may be a couple of minor updates between releases, mostly with bug fixes. Since there is only one main developer, the release cycle will ultimately depend on his code frequency and on the number of contributors actively helping during that time frame. 

After a new version has been released and to avoid having to release a new one shortly after, any new implemented functionalities can be tested in the Alpha version by users and contributors alike.

###Introduction

### Project structure


####Release Schedule

Looking at the first table we found that initially very close to the beginning of the launch of the first version of this project, several changes were released from the same version on the same day and even multiple versions have been released in a short time (from day to day) due to suggestions that emerged from the users and even to correct some bugs detected.
However, from version 1.9.3.1 the project now has two versions, one of them the Alpha version, in order to avoid that the next version of the application contains many bugs.

Introduction

At this stage we will describe the software structure of RedReader, based on the source code and the project documentation, made available.
Poorly designed architectures can lead to instabilities, inability to support requirements - present or future - and difficulty in applying or managing the production environment. This is where software architecture comes in - the fundamental organization of a system, formed by its components, the relationships between them and the principles that shape its design and evolution. Our approach to RedReader architecture will be based on model 4 + 1 software architecture views. The 4 views represent the logical view, implementation view, process view and distribution view, with the additional view (+1) being the use-cases view, the diagram of which has already been presented in the last report.
